# Timeline-of-cholera
Original timeline of cholera, published on Wikipedia

'''[[Cholera]]''' is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. It infects the small intestine. Cholera is still active throughout the world. Estimates from 2010 say that between three- and five million people get cholera every year, and 58,000–130,000 people die from the disease every year.<ref name=Loz2012>{{cite journal | author = Lozano R, Naghavi M, ''et al.'' 2012 | title = Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 | journal = Lancet | volume = 380 | issue = 9859 | pages = 2095–128 | pmid = 23245604 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0 | date=Dec 2012}}</ref>

|-
| Present times ||  The [[seventh cholera pandemic]] continues today at a much smaller scale with outbreaks across the developing world. Epidemics occur after war, civil unrest, or natural disasters when water and food supplies become contaminated with ''vibrio cholerae'' in areas with crowded living conditions and poor sanitation.<ref name="Background" />

| 1979 || Scientific development (treatment) || [[Oral rehydration therapy]] (ORT) is introduced as a technique of fluid replacement used to prevent or treat dehydration especially due to [[diarrhea]]. ORT rapidly becomes the cornerstone of programmes for the control of diarrhoeal diseases. Oral rehydration therapy dramatically would brought down the cholera case fatality rate from 30% in 1980 to around 3.6% in 2000.<ref name="From endotoxin to exotoxin: De’s rich legacy to cholera"/><ref name="Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy.">{{cite journal|title=Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy.| pmid=11100619 | volume=78 | pmc=2560623| year=2000| journal=Bull.
